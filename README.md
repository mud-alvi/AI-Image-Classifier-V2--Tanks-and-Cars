# A Basic image classifier I made as a way to distinguish between tanks and cars

- This whole classifier was coded on jupyter because I found this out that it was way easier to code in modules esp for training and checking accuracy
- I then exported the pth file to huggingface and made a small app module there to run it since that is the simplest and the best way to run your code
- so yea enjoy :)
