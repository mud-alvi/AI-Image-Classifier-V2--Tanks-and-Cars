# A Basic image classifier I made as a way to distinguish between tanks and cars

- This whole classifier was coded on jupyter because I found this out that it was way easier to code in modules esp for training and checking accuracy

  # TO CREATE THE CLASSIFIER YOUR SELF
  1. firstly create a folder called "Z_Image" on your desktop.
  2. add a "train" folder and a "cars_tanks" excel sheet which can be taken from above.
  3. then take the main source code cited above and execute it as a whole on VS code and at the end there is an option to save it, do that.
  4. now you will have your own pth file within the "Z_Image" folder.
  5. now open huggingface on your browser and create a space. Furthermore, in the files section of the space, add the pth file, app.py file and requirements.txt file which can be copied from above
  6. and then let the huggingface application do the work by creating the website
  7. It will take maximum of approx 10 mins and you wiil be met by the interface where you can upload an image of your liking and the classifier will tell you if it looks like a tank or a car :O
- so yea enjoy :)
